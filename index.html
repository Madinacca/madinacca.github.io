        <li><strong>Dr. Ali Zafar Mallick:</strong> His mentorship inspired us to dedicate 2.5% of our profits to orphanage support programs and shaped our commitment to leading with empathy.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>With every project, Madinacca Builders ensures that families have access to larger square footage, luxury finishes, and affordable living options, without compromising on sustainability. Together, we are building a brighter future—one home at a time.</p>

    <h2>Guided by Purpose: The Mentors Who Shaped Us</h2>
    <p>Our journey has been profoundly influenced by the wisdom and guidance of two remarkable mentors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pablo Bottaro:</strong> A beacon of strategic leadership and human connection. His belief that "good is inevitable" has profoundly shaped our approach to leadership, problem-solving, and fostering meaningful relationships.</li>
      <li><strong>Dr. Ali Zafar Mallick:</strong> His mentorship inspired us to dedicate 2.5% of our profits to orphanage support programs and shaped our commitment to leading with empathy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Our Promise</h2>
    <p>With every project, Madinacca Builders ensures that families have access to larger square footage, luxury finishes, and affordable living options, without compromising on sustainability. Together, we are building a brighter future—one home at a time.</p>
